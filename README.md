This project implements  A* Algorithm for solving the Gem Puzzle problem.




## RESULTS: 




The table below summarizes the results for different puzzle dimension, derived from a single execution of the algorithm. 

|  **Puzzle dimension**| **Quality**|**Cost** | 
|---|---|---|
| 3 |   20 | 600| 
| 4 | 62 | 123098 | 
| 5 | 130 | 633136 |

The execution time for a puzzle of dimension 3 is negligible. For a dimension of 4, the execution time ranges between 5 and 12 seconds. 
For a dimension of 5, the execution time is highly variable, can range from a few minutes to several hours.






The exercise was carried out in collaboration with Lorenzo di Rosa  (329169)
